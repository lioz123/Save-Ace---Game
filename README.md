# Save Ace Arcade Game
This game was developed from scratch in Java with Graphics2D.
## Summary
This is the first project I have built outside of the school boundaries. Although this project is 5 years old, it shows the creativity of the tools I have developed and the problem solving abilities of Bugs.


## About

Your objective in this game is to find clues about Ace's whereabouts and gather allies to break out of prison and rescue your brother in time before he is executed.
